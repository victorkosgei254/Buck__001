    "A buck regulator gives an output voltage which is less than the input voltage, this regulator offers high efficiency. Unlike Linear regulators which dissipates the excess power as heat, buck regulator does not , instead it uses PWM to adjust the switching time and thus regulate the power throughput.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This regulator has found  many applications especially in electronics, microprocessor, microcontrollers, ASICs and different embedded systems require different power level, some logic gates require 3.3 volts, others 5V and some may go as high as 15V i.e driver circuits.  In order to power each of these circuits from a single power source, we have to split the power into different voltages for different applications.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The design of a regulator is fairly straightforward,Theoretically, lets  say you have  28pins IC, each pin may require 1mA as a driving current that gives a total sum of 28mA of current, and maybe you have 5 such ICs resulting to 140mA. Giving a margin of 50% we get total current of 210mA at 5 V, you have couple of sensors each roughly taking 500mA at 5V, say 2 of such resulting to a 1A,  at 5V,furthermore you have a BJT switch with a driving gate voltage of 15V at 1A and finally a crystal oscillator that requires 3.3V at 20mA .\r\n",

    "Notice the switching frequency I have left blank as I am to determine this frequency based on the MOSFET switch I will choose, lets say I choose a switch with a switching time of 0.1uS, for maximum efficiency and reduction of switching loss, the switching period should be 100 times bigger than this which results to 10uS translating to s switching frequency of 100kHz.\r\n",

    "Considering an input voltage of 24V, using an LDO to power this circuit is inefficient, as I need to dissipate 19V @ 1A as heat to achieve the power requirement. Besides being inefficient, this will call for increase in manufacturing cost as I need a fan , heat sinks to do some thermal management, therefore a buck regulator is the best choice to power this circuit.\r\n",
